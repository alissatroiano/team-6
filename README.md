## Introduction

This is a website providing information about LGBTQIA+ art throughout history. In keeping with Pride 2022 Theme: Togetherness, this website provides information on famous LGBTQA+ artists along with photo representation of a quintessential art piece from their repertoire. The website also provides information on local LGBTQA+ artists and how they can be contacted. The site is targeted towards not just the LGBTQA+ community, but to those interested in expanding their knowledge of art and looking to support local LGBTQA+ artists by adding to their art collection.
